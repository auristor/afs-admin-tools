# Rules specifying the default ACLs that should be set on volumes created with
# volcreate.  See the volcreate man page for more information.
#
# The format of this file should be a regular expression matching a class of
# volumes, surrounded by // and starting in the first column, and then
# followed by whitespace-indented user/ACL pairs that apply to that class of
# volumes, one per line.  For example:
#
#    /^user\./
#        system:administrators read
#
# All matching regular expressions will contribute their set of ACL settings
# to the final ACL string.  Any ACLs given on the command line of volcreate
# will take precedence over the ones in this file (but the ones in this file
# will still be applied -- the ACLs will be merged).
