# A list of AFS servers for your local site, their physical locations, and the
# classes of volumes that should be put on that server (or that server
# partition or partition range).  This file defines the types that can then be
# used as values for the -t option to volcreate.  See the volcreate man page
# for more information.
#
# The syntax of each line is:
#
#     <server> [<location>] <type> ... <partition>:<type> ...
#
# The [] here are part of the syntax; they do not represent an optional
# element.  For example:
#
#     afssvr10 [west] user a-b:data c:logs
#
# This defines a server named afssvr10 (in the local domain) whose location is
# "west".  Locations are used to distribute read-only replicas over as many
# locations as possible.  Volumes of type "user" can be put on any partition
# on this server.  Volumes of type "data" can be put on partitions a or b, and
# volumes of type "logs" can be put on partition c.
#
# There is additional syntax for specifying the read/write and read-only
# locations for a volume type by appending -rw and -ro to the volume type.
# See the volcreate man page.
