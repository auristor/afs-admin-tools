 * This currently enforces a Stanford-specific restriction of mount points
   starting with /afs/.ir/.  It should instead canonicalize mount points
   to something appropriate for the local cell.  (Perhaps require the RW
   version of a fully-qualified cell name?)  The restriction should also
   be conditional on loadmtpt support being enabled.
