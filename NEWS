                   User-Visible afs-admin-tools Changes

afs-admin-tools 2.0 (unreleased)

    Initial tarball release, based on frak 1.34, fsr 1.14, lsmounts 1.8,
    mvto 1.17, partinfo 1.3, volcreate 1.26, volcreate-logs 1.22, and
    volnuke 1.15.

    All utilities now load /etc/afs-admin-tools/config if it exists and
    honor configuration variables set there.  All utilities now document
    their supported configuration variables.

    Look for AFS utilities on the user's PATH by default, except for vos
    where /usr/local/sbin and /usr/sbin are checked first (since those
    directories may not be on the PATH).

    Remove support for Kerberos v4 authentication in volcreate-logs.  This
    only applies to the -k option, not to use of pre-existing credentials.
