                   User-Visible afs-admin-tools Changes

afs-admin-tools 2.0 (unreleased)

    Initial tarball release, based on frak 1.34, fsr 1.14, lsmounts 1.8,
    mvto 1.17, partinfo 1.3, volcreate 1.26, volcreate-logs 1.22, and
    volnuke 1.15.

    All utilities now load /etc/afs-admin-tools/config if it exists and
    honor configuration variables set there.  All utilities now document
    their supported configuration variables.

    Look for AFS utilities on the user's PATH by default, except for vos
    where /usr/local/sbin and /usr/sbin are checked first (since those
    directories may not be on the PATH).

    volcreate no longer requires mount points begin with the
    Stanford-specific path prefix.  Instead, a new configuration variable,
    $VOLCREATE_MOUNT_PREFIX, can be set in the configuration file to
    require mount point paths begin with that prefix.  If the prefix
    requires read/write paths and the read-only path is given, it will be
    converted automatically rather than failing.

    volcreate no longer runs loadmtpt by default.  To enable loadmtpt
    support, set $LOADMTPT in the configuration file to the path to the
    loadmtpt utility.  Checking of the mount point prefix is only done if
    loadmtpt support is enabled, since otherwise it doesn't matter how the
    mount point path is designated.

    Remove support for Kerberos v4 authentication in volcreate-logs.  This
    only applies to the -k option, not to use of pre-existing credentials.
